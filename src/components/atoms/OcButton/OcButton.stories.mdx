# OcButton

Buttons are generally used for interface actions. Suitable for all-purpose use.

Defaults to appearance that has white background with blue border.
Filled appearance should be used only once per view for main call-to-action.
All buttons are built with a css grid which ensures that there will be a pre-defined gutter between all child items.

## Accessibility

### Distinction when to use a `<button>`, when to use an `<a>`

Regardless of the visual representation the following differentiation should be made if in doubt what to choose.

- an anchor/link changes the location, be it internally on the website, or to another resource/document/route.
- a button does change the state of the website, e.g.: adds, deletes, opens, ...

### Accessible name

The accessible name ([explainer for the term](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2017/04/what-is-an-accessible-name/)) of a button is derived from several sources. Right now, only two of them are relevant:

1. The value of the `aria-label` attribute
2. The text between the opening and closing tag, `<button>This text here</button>`

When an aria-label attribute exists, its value will override the button text. So in this case, the accessible name would be "foo": `<button aria-label="foo">Bar</button>`, although visual users will see "Bar". This difference between accessible name and visual name is a problem for a certain type of assistive technology ([explainer for the term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology)), this is why the [WCAG success criterion 2.5.3, "Label in name"](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#label-in-name) exists. This difference should be avoided, if it can't, W3C recommends that the accessible name should start with visible label.

### Icon-only button

Every button has to have an accessible name. It cannot be provided by a text between the button tags (for example, because it is an icon button; see "Upload" example below), the accessible name has to be provided by `aria-label`.

<!-- ## Examples

export const Template = (args) => ({
  components: { OcButton },
  data(){
    return {
      args: {ariaLabel: args.text, ...args}
    }
  },
  template: `
    <div>
      <oc-button v-bind="args">{{args.text}}</oc-button>
    </div>`,
});

### Standard

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Standard"
    args={{
      text: 'CLICK ME!',
    }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Disabled

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Disabled"
    args={{
      text: 'CLICK ME!',
      disabled: true
    }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas> -->
